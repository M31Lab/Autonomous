## üåü Overview

M31 Autonomous is an advanced AI coding assistant for VS Code that analyzes your codebase, creates and modifies code, runs commands, and controls browsers - all with your explicit permission. It combines the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) with a carefully designed agentic workflow to help you solve complex programming tasks while maintaining full control.

## üöÄ Installation

### VS Code Marketplace

1. Install the extension from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=m31lab.m31-autonomous)
2. Configure your preferred API provider in the extension settings
3. Start your first task by writing a request in the chat box

### Manual Installation(Will Be Open Source Soon)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/m31lab/Autonomous.git
cd Autonomous
npm run install:all
npm run package
code --install-extension m31-autonomous-*.vsix
```

## üîå Supported AI Providers

M31 Autonomous works with multiple AI providers, giving you flexibility in choosing the backend that best fits your needs:

| Provider | Models | Benefits |
|----------|--------|----------|
| **Claude (Anthropic)** | Claude 3 Opus, Sonnet, Haiku | Highest quality, best reasoning |
| **OpenAI** | GPT-4o, GPT-4, GPT-3.5 | Widely available, versatile |
| **OpenRouter** | Various models | Access to multiple providers |
| **AWS Bedrock** | Claude, Titan, Llama | Enterprise-grade security |
| **LM Studio** | Any compatible model | Local execution, no data sharing |

## üí° Quick Start Guide

### Starting Your First Task

1. Open the M31 Autonomous sidebar in VS Code
2. Type a natural language request, such as:
   - "Create a React component for a user profile"
   - "Fix the error in this function" 
   - "Set up a basic Express server with MongoDB"

### Using Context Providers

Enhance your requests with specific context using the @ syntax:

- `@file:path/to/file.js` - Reference a specific file
- `@folder:src/components` - Reference a directory
- `@url:https://example.com` - Reference a web page
- `@git:commit` - Reference Git information

### Command Palette Integration

Access M31 Autonomous features through the VS Code command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P / Cmd+Shift+P):

- **M31-Autonomous: Open in New Tab** - Opens the assistant in a dedicated tab
- **M31-Autonomous: Add to M31-Autonomous** - Adds selected code to the chat
- **M31-Autonomous: Generate Git Commit Message** - Creates a commit message for staged changes

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Features

### AI Git Commit Integration

Streamline your Git workflow with intelligent commit message generation:

- Click the "AI Commit" button in the status bar or use Alt+C shortcut
- M31 analyzes your staged changes and suggests a conventional commit message
- One-click options to commit, edit, or commit and push

### Browser Automation

M31 can interact with web browsers to help test and debug web applications:

```
Can you open my React app at http://localhost:3000 and test the login form?
```

M31 will launch a browser, navigate to your app, interact with the UI, and report results.

### Terminal Command Execution

Run terminal commands with confidence:

```
Can you set up a new Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS?
```

M31 will suggest and execute the necessary commands (with your approval) to complete the task.

### Personalization with Rules

Create a `.m31rules` file in your project root to customize M31's behavior:

```
Always use TypeScript strict mode.
Prefer functional components over class components in React.
Follow the project's existing code style and patterns.
```

## üîí Privacy & Security

M31 Autonomous prioritizes your security and privacy:

- **Explicit Permission**: Every action requires your approval
- **Access Control**: Use `.m31ignore` to specify directories/files M31 shouldn't access
- **Secure API Keys**: All API keys are stored securely using VS Code's secrets storage
- **Local Execution**: Support for local models through LM Studio
